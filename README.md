# Python Code for the CMC Dashboard

==============================

> Project created to parse TN Covid Data so that I can create a dashboard.

## Development Environment

To set up the development environment, follow the steps outlined in ["The right and wrong way to set Python 3 as default on a Mac"](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac). The steps should be similar to setup in the windows environment.

Folder layout is based on:
[cookiecutter data science project template](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).
